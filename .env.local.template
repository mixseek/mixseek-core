# .env.local - Per-Machine Docker User Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This file allows you to override Docker container user settings for your
# local development environment without affecting other team members.
#
# USAGE:
#   1. Copy this file to .env.local:
#      cp .env.local.template .env.local
#
#   2. Uncomment and set your host user's UID/GID:
#      id -u  # Get your UID
#      id -g  # Get your GID
#
#   3. Update the values below
#
# NOTE:
#   - .env.local is gitignored and won't be committed to the repository
#   - If not specified, defaults to 1000:1000 (safe for macOS GID 20 conflict)
#   - Environment variables (export MIXSEEK_UID=xxx) take highest priority
#
# =============================================================================

# Docker container user UID (default: 1000)
# Uncomment and set to your host user's UID for proper file permissions
#MIXSEEK_UID=1000

# Docker container user GID (default: 1000)
# Uncomment and set to your host user's GID for proper file permissions
#MIXSEEK_GID=1000

# Docker container username (default: mixseek_core)
# Usually no need to change this
#MIXSEEK_USERNAME=mixseek_core

# =============================================================================
# EXAMPLES
# =============================================================================
# Linux user with UID 2000, GID 2000:
#   MIXSEEK_UID=2000
#   MIXSEEK_GID=2000
#
# macOS user (typically UID 501, but GID 20 conflicts with dialout):
#   MIXSEEK_UID=501
#   MIXSEEK_GID=1000
#
# To find your UID/GID, run:
#   id -u && id -g
# =============================================================================
